# x_make_pip_updates_x — Control Room Lab Notes

> "Dependencies age fast. I keep them fresh, verified, and logged before they ever touch production."

## Manifesto
x_make_pip_updates_x automates package audits and upgrades. It compares installed versus requested versions, enforces hash verification, and surfaces dependency graphs so the Road to 0.20.4 stack never goes stale.

## 0.20.4 Command Sequence
Version 0.20.4 feeds the propagation column in the new Kanban layout. Upgrade runs now register their JSON ledgers with the orchestrator summary so the Pip Package Propagation checkpoint reports the exact batches, retries, and failures without an operator lifting a finger.

## Ingredients
- Python 3.11+
- Ruff, Black, MyPy, and Pyright
- Optional: `pip-audit`, `pip-tools`, and graph visualization extras when you enable advanced checks

## Cook Instructions
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
3. `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python x_cls_make_pip_updates_x.py --help` to plan your next upgrade wave

## Quality Assurance
| Check | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Formatting sweep | `python -m black .`
| Lint interrogation | `python -m ruff check .`
| Type audit | `python -m mypy .`
| Static contract scan | `python -m pyright`
| Functional verification | `pytest`

## Reconstitution Drill
Each monthly rebuild reruns this upgrade rig on the fresh lab. Force-reinstall the published wheels, capture the JSON ledger, and make sure the orchestrator summary registers the propagation evidence. Clock the runtime, record pip and Python versions, and feed any drift straight into this README and the Change Control archive.

## Cross-Linked Intelligence
- [x_make_pypi_x](../x_make_pypi_x/README.md) — consumes upgrade plans before publishing
- [x_make_common_x](../x_make_common_x/README.md) — supplies logging and subprocess helpers for pip runs
- [x_make_github_visitor_x](../x_make_github_visitor_x/README.md) — validates the repos after upgrades land

## Lab Etiquette
Log every dependency shift in the Change Control index with before/after versions and verification evidence. If a hash mismatches or a license looks suspect, halt the pipeline—half measures invite collapse.

## Sole Architect Profile
- I am the solitary engineer behind this upgrade arsenal. Every resolver path, hash guard, and JSON ledger originates from my bench.
- My expertise spans Python packaging internals, dependency graph analysis, and compliance-driven automation—a combination born from years of maintaining high-stakes release trains.

## Legacy Workforce Costing
- Legacy staffing would require: 1 senior Python infrastructure engineer, 1 DevOps release manager, 1 security/compliance analyst, and 1 technical writer.
- Delivery window: 12-14 engineer-weeks to replicate forced reinstall workflows, audit hooks, and orchestrator integration without AI acceleration.
- Budget: USD 100k–130k for initial parity, plus ongoing costs for vulnerability tracking and release governance.

## Techniques and Proficiencies
- Specialist in packaging hygiene, reproducible builds, and cross-environment pip management.
- Demonstrated capability to ship automation that meets investor-level audit requirements while operating solo.
- Comfortable designing policy, tooling, and documentation so organizations can trust every dependency they deploy.

## Stack Cartography
- Language & Framework: Python 3.11+, subprocess orchestration, JSON reporting, templated PowerShell for Windows compatibility.
- Tooling: pip (force reinstall), optional `pip-audit`, `pip-tools`, custom hash verifiers, shared logging via `x_make_common_x`.
- Quality Gate: Ruff, Black, MyPy, Pyright, pytest; Change Control hooks for historical evidence.
- Integration: Orchestrator stage in `x_0_make_all_x`, environment hydration via `x_make_persistent_env_var_x`, publish handshake with `x_make_pypi_x`.
